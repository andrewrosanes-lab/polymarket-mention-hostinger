# Mention Edge — Hostinger Docker deployment

This repository contains the Polymarket mention-market bot and dashboard.

## Safe initial deployment

Import the repository URL in Hostinger Docker Manager. The initial Compose
configuration builds the dashboard and starts the live bot. Compose fails
closed unless the required wallet variables are supplied through Hostinger.
No wallet credentials are included in this repository.

Open the dashboard at `http://YOUR_VPS_IP:3000` after Hostinger reports the
deployment healthy.

## Live activation

Live activation was explicitly approved by the owner. Never commit a private
key. Add credentials only through Hostinger's protected environment-variable
UI. Required variables are `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY` and
`POLYMARKET_FUNDER_ADDRESS`; CLOB API credentials are optional because the
client can derive them from the wallet.
